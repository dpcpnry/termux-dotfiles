Some Termux dot files on my phone:

They are:

- .bashrc : not much
- termux.properties : especially configured extra keys for `neovim`
- .zshrc : many personal stuff, many shortcuts or alias
- .init.vim : python and javascript IDE. Mostly copy and paste snippets fromna few Internet guides.

They may not work well for you, consider not blindly copy and paste.
